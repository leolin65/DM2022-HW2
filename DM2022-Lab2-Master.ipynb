    "Overall Naive Bayes model(0.70) outperform the Decision Tree model(0.68) with the average precision, recall and F1 score (0.7 Vs 0.68) Compare between the two model.\n",
    "Decision Trees is very flexible, easy to understand. However, it tends to overfit the training data, which we can see from the high training accuracy score(0.99) but low score in testing accuracy score(training 0.99 : testing 0.68). \n",

    "I list the weak reason of Decision tree is below:\n",
    "a.Decision tree can be extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the data: a slight change can result in a drastically different tree.\n",
    "b.Decision tree can easily overfit. This can be negated by validation methods and pruning, but this is a grey area.\n",
    "c.Decision tree can have problems out-of-sample prediction (this is related to them being non-smooth).\n",
    "\n",
    "As decision trees use the ‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù method, they tend to perform well if a few highly relevant attributes exist, but less so if many complex interactions are present. Decision tree pruning may neglect some key values in training data, which can lead the accuracy for a toss. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Naive bayes assume that there are no dependencies amongst attributes. This assumption is called class conditional independence. the classifier use probabilities principle does not require large amounts of data before learning can begin and computationally fast when making decisions."
